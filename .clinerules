This blog site uses NextJS to generate and serve static files


## Testing

- Before running `npm run dev`, test to see if a port `3000` is already opened. If it is, reuse the existing development server instead of staring a new one
- You do not need to ask for permission to launch a browser at a url starting with `http://localhost`
