My first trip to Italy went by incredibly fast -- 15 days have never gone so fast, or been so full of new things to see and experience. Contrast may be the spice of life, and in Italy I found plenty of it. From the history of the cathedrals in Florence & Rome, to the canals of Venice both wide and narrow, to the incredibly stunning layered mountains of the Amalfi Coast, I found a world that was wildly foreign and incredible with just a tinge of the familiar.

Thankfully, I have plenty of photos to look back on. Some of them are a particular fit for a phone wallpaper, which I'm sharing here. Click on any of these images, and you'll see the full resolution version and a download button.
